I decided to setup a personal website, I will use this as
a place to reference people to and it's setup so I can blog.

It's built with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site
generator and I'm currently using GitHub pages to host it. You can find
the source files [here](https://github.com/funrep/funrep.github.io/tree/develop).
